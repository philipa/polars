August 2024

I've made the following changes in the hope of improving the utility
of the polars for passage planning.

- Significantly reduced the upwind (40°, 45°, 50°) figures by 9-17%.
  This should remove the ridiculous tacking angles that TimeZero and
  PW have been proposing.

- Reduced the 160° figures for white sails, and removed the use of the
  furlex at 160°. The genoa and furlex are both significantly
  blanketed between 155° and 170° (without hacks like poling out the
  staysail to windward).

- Removed the use of the furlex at 18kts, 70°, 90°.

- Slightly increased some 180° values for the furlex.
